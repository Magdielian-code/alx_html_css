Title: Headphones Website

Overview
The "Headphones" project is a simple, multi-section landing page designed for a headphones business. It uses HTML5 and CSS3 to build a structured, responsive design, integrating external resources like FontAwesome for social media icons. The website includes sections for navigation, a description of services, results metrics, and a contact form.

Features
Responsive Design: The layout adapts to different screen sizes through CSS media queries. The mobile version is triggered when the screen width is 480px or less.

Custom Navigation: The website has a navigation bar that links to different sections of the page like "What We Do," "Our Results," and "Contact Us."

Interactive Elements: Includes interactive buttons (Call-to-Action) and hover effects to enhance user experience.

Icons: FontAwesome icons are used for the social media section in the footer.

Contact Form: A contact form is provided to allow users to send messages directly from the webpage.

Code Structure
HTML: The core structure of the page includes semantic elements such as <header>, <main>, and <footer>, giving the page a clean structure and supporting accessibility.

CSS: The 7-styles.css file manages the styling, while reset.css ensures that the layout behaves consistently across different browsers by resetting default styles.
